# dotnet-alpine-fips
Base docker image for self-contained dotnet core apps on top of Alpine Linux with FIPS 140-2 OpenSSL and optina

`alpine-fips` combines a [base Alpine image](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine/) with [FIPS 140-2 enabled OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/docs/fips.html).

## Build steps

### Alpine FIPS base image

The `Dockerfile` builds the FIPS canister per the requirements in  "OpenSSL FIPS 140-2 Security Policy Version 2.0.16." 
It also verifies the SHA256 hash and PGP signatures of the OpenSSL and FIPS Module source based on OpenSSL's best practices recommendations. Finally, it builds and runs a simple C test program to verify that toggling FIPS mode actually works. This test program is only used in the Docker image build process and does not appear in the final image.

## Dotnet Core dependencies

## Not FIPS-compliant

This Docker image itself is not FIPS compliant. The Security Policy requires "An independently acquired FIPS 140­-2 validated implementation of SHA­1 HMAC must be used for this digest verification." The SHA1 HMAC in this image is validated by a non-FIPS 140-2, vanilla OpenSSL installation. However, feel free to modify this `Dockerfile` for use with a FIPS module you validate with your own FIPS 140-2 implementation.

The goal of this project is to provide a convenient image to test software builds in FIPS mode.
